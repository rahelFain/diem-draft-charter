# Introduction

Emblems such as the Red Cross, Red Crescent, Red Crystal, and Blue Shield can be symbols of
protection governed by International Humanitarian Law (IHL).  Emblems can also
be identified by other laws or ISO standards that parties need to be able to apply
to digital infrastructure.

There is a need to present emblems through digital communication channels.

Digital emblems extend the range of identifying marks from the physical (visual and tactile) to the digital realm.
The presence of a digital emblem represents a new signal available to cyber operators. 

The DIEM WG will define an architecture and discovery mechanism enabling digital emblems to be presented and validated across applications and platforms in a cohesive way.

# Architectural Consideration

"To bear an emblem" means to present or display an identifying mark. 
The entity that bears the emblem is respectively the subject of the emblem or emblem holder. 
This is often a separate entity from the creator or original designer of the emblem.

"To validate an emblem" means to confirm the authenticity or legitimacy of a particular symbol or design, often by checking its details against a known standard or reference point. 
Validation may include ensuring that the subject has not forged, stolen, or tampered with an emblem.
Emblems may be observed by validators without the knowledge of the subject displaying the emblem, or may be presented to a specific validator upon request.
Cryptographic verification may or may not be used based on the in-place security mechanisms of the communication channel bearing the emblem.
Which attributes an emblem contains, and how a digital emblem is secured and presented impacts how a validator interprets and trusts the assertions made within the emblem.

# Initial Scope

The DIEM WG will ensure maximum reuse of work for emblem representation and validation, facilitate re-use of existing protocols and capabilities, and ensure that existing standards are leveraged appropriately.
A discovery mechanism for the initial work will only be specified by this group after the initial emblem validation procedure is completed (see the Deliverables section below).

The working group is initially limited to specifying discovery mechanisms that rely on digital communication such as the use of DNS or well-known locations on a host identified by a hostname or IP address.
Only discovery mechanisms where the validation remains unknown to the subject of the emblem are considered in the initial scope.
The design of discovery mechanisms using proximity-based protocols such as QRCodes, NFC, or Bluetooth is out-of-scope.
The working group will not produce any standards track generic serialization formats. 
The working group will not produce any standards track extensions to the DNS. 
The working group will not develop novel security mechanisms, cryptographic primitives, or digital signature schemes. 

# Deliverables

The DIEM WG will work on the following deliverables for the defined scope strictly in this order:

1. Use cases and requirements for the initial target scenarios (Informational):
   Initially, the working group will develop and maintain an informational use cases and requirements document, but is not required to request publication of this document. 
   This document must describe at least one digital emblem suitable for indicating protection under IHL and at least one digital emblem suitable for indicating the presence of a hazard or a certification of the absence of a hazard.
   This work must not assume any specific serialization format or discovery mechanisms.
   As part of this document, the working group will research, analyze and evaluate application layer serialization formats focusing on data structures that match discovery protocols used in the initial scope, such as DNS records or structured fields in DNS, as well as the respective securing mechanisms for digital emblems. 
   The group is not required to describe object level securing mechanisms, in the case that existing protocol level securing mechanisms are sufficient, for example DNSSEC for DNS records, or TLS for well known HTTPS URLs. 

2. An architecture containing a taxonomy, data model, and overall information flows (Informational):
   The working group will develop a high level architecture and data model that includes a taxonomy defining the terminology to be used in future working group documents but start this work only after the use case and requirements document has reached group consensus. 
   The architecture must not assume any specific serialization formats or securing and discovery mechanisms.

3. A protocol specification describing the discovery of digital emblems (Proposed Standard or Experimental):
   After the architecture and data model are finished, the working group will specify a validation and discovery mechanism addressing one or two of the initial use cases.
   This specification may describe a mandatory to implement securing mechanism. 
   If a securing mechanism is described, at least one mandatory to implement cryptographic algorithm which is already supported by the securing mechanism must be described as well.
